    Rocky Balboa is one of my two heroes. He is the hero that comes from a semi-fictional background. I have a hero who is real, but I feel like people would recognize Rocky much faster and have better context for why he's my hero. Rocky is a winner. He trains hard to be an athlete and makes sacrifices to help his family and career. Rocky is always an underdog, and he's a great source of inspiration to me. Whether it's up against the heavyweight champion, a psychotic cheating Soviet, or Mr. T, he always finds a way. He's a nice guy to people who give him crap, and cares deeply about his friends and family.

    Rocky is a man of values. He is religious, and puts his family and friends above everything. He is always optimistic and never gives up in any circumstance. He teaches a great lesson of self-discipline, humility, compassion, acceptance, forgiveness, and tenacity. Rocky sticks to his morals and proves that no matter what he never gives up. I first watched "Rocky" when I was about 9 years old and his courage and tenacity have stuck with me ever since. Rocky has inspired me to believe in myself and never give up hope.
